2. **Filter** those websites based on various criteria (active domains, Shopify usage, load speed, and keyword exclusions).
3. **Scrape emails** from the filtered websites.
4. **Download results** from each step as CSV files via an interactive dashboard interface.

## 🖥️ Tech Stack

### 🔧 Backend (Python + Flask)
- `Flask` – API endpoints and routing
- `requests` – HTTP requests to check live domains and scrape content
- `re` – Regex for email extraction
- `BeautifulSoup (bs4)` – HTML parsing
- `time` – Response time measurement
- `csv` – Read/write CSV files
- `os` – File handling

### 💻 Frontend (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Responsive dashboard layout with:
  - Website input panel
  - Filtering panel (with drag-and-drop)
  - Email scraper panel (with drag-and-drop)
  - Results display tab (download buttons + CSV content)

## 🧪 How It Works

### 1. **Fetch Websites**
- Enter:
  - Country
  - City Keyword
  - Industry Keyword
  - Result Count
- Submits a request to `/fetch`
- Returns a CSV (`websites.csv`) with potential domains

### 2. **Filter Websites**
- Upload `websites.csv`
- System:
  - Tests for live response
  - Detects Shopify (via script tags or page content)
  - Measures load time
  - Applies exclusion keyword list
- Returns `filtered_websites.csv`

### 3. **Scrape Emails**
- Upload `filtered_websites.csv`
- System:
  - Visits homepage and internal links like `/contact`
  - Extracts emails using regex
- Returns `emails.csv` with domain + email mapping

### 4. **Result Download**
- Final results displayed in a table
- All CSVs can be downloaded via a dedicated tab
